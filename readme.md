# Junkathon

Submission for the BostonHacks Junkathon 2019 - hackathon for the worst ideas!

## What is the hardest part of studying?
Distraction, right?
My teammate and I thought a great idea for a bad idea hackathon would be to make peoples' lives harder by distracting them when they try to study!

## Presenting FocusNot, a Chrome extension designed to distract!

You want to study? Challenge accepted! If you have this extension enabled, you'll be bombarded with memes every few minutes to keep you from getting your work done.

Let's see how you study now.
